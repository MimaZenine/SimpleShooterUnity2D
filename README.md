Intro to a Simple Shooter with Unity2D
======================================

Unity2D is a game engine that was established in 2013. At first, Unity was solely for developing 3D games, but developers were able to finagle with the camera and position, which allowed the game to be seen in 2D mode. Thankfully, Unity integrated a 2D capability which made it easier to develop in an environment specified for 2D assets.

Within these folders, you will find:

•	Scripts

•	Assets

•	Sounds

I recommend downloading and installing Unity first.
